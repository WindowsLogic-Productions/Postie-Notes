## What does it do?

- **Save your ideas:** Jot down any idea you have and when you close a note, it automatically saves.
- **Easily open saved notes:** Open a note and it will appear on the Memoboard. You can even open notes externally outside of the Memoboard.
- **Memoboard:** Open notes reside on board contained within the program, unless opened externally.
- **Encryption:** Encrypt your notes easily without any knowledge on encryption or decryption.
- **Colours:** Choose the colour you want notes to be.
- **Password protection:** Password protect your encrypted notes to avoid tampering by outside sources. (In-development)
- **Works on most Windows PCs:** Supports Windows 98 SE and newer, so you don’t need the latest computer.
- **No complicated steps:** Just download, open, and click a direction or button to configure your controller.
